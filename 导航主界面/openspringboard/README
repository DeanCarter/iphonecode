OpenSpringBoard
===============

UIKit based Spingboard clone, similar to Three20's TTLauncherView. This code is based on our Fieldforce app which was approved by Apple, so hopefully it's compliant with their terms, but YMMV.

"Sringboard" is the native iOS app launcher, OpenSpringBoard is a clone written in UIKit (4.1). Helpful if you're trying to create Facebook, LinkedIn or other "homescreen" based navigation apps.
